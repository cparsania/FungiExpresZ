abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html webcite.},

abstract = {The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans resides asymptomatically in the gut of most healthy people but causes serious invasive diseases in immunocompromised patients. Many C. albicans strains have the ability to stochastically switch between distinct white and opaque cell types, but it is not known with certainty what role this switching plays in the physiology of the organism. Here, we report a previously undescribed difference between white and opaque cells, namely their interaction with host phagocytic cells. We show that both Drosophila hemocyte-derived S2 cells and mouse macrophage-derived RAW264.7 cells preferentially phagocytose white cells over opaque cells. This difference is seen both in the overall percentage of cultured cells that phagocytose white versus opaque C. albicans and in the average number of C. albicans taken up by each phagocytic cell. We conclude that susceptibility to phagocytosis by cells of the innate immune system is an important distinction between white and opaque C. albicans, and propose that one role of switching from the prevalent white form into the rarer opaque form may be to allow C. albicans to escape phagocytosis.},

HISAT's hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of ∼64,000 bp. Tests on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes of any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

In the characterized strain WO-1, cells switched heritably, reversibly, and at a high frequency (approximately 10(-2] between two phenotypes readily distinguishable by the size, shape, and color of colonies formed on agar at 25 degrees C. In this system, referred to as the "white-opaque transition," cells formed either "white" hemispherical colonies, which were similar to the ones formed by standard laboratory strains of C. albicans, or "opaque" colonies, which were larger, flatter, and grey. At least three other heritable colony phenotypes were generated by WO-1 and included one irregular-wrinkle and two fuzzy colony phenotypes. The basis of the white-opaque transition appears to be a fundamental difference in cellular morphology. White cells were similar in shape, size, and budding pattern to cells of common laboratory strains. In dramatic contrast, opaque cells were bean shaped and exhibited three times the volume and twice the mass of white cells, even though these alternative phenotypes contained the same amount of DNA and a single nucleus in the log phase. In addition to differences in morphology, white and opaque cells differed in their generation time, in their sensitivity to low and high temperatures, and in their capacity to form hypae. The possible molecular mechanisms involved in high-frequency switching in the white-opaque transition are considered.},

abstract = {The relationship to pathogenesis of the spontaneous phenotypic switching of Candida albicans is uncertain. Since neutrophils are critical in containment of disseminated candidiasis, we used these cells and some of their potentially microbicidal oxidative products to define effects on a C. albicans strain (WO-1) that exhibits characteristic, easily recognized switching between the white and opaque phenotypes. Blastoconidia of the opaque phenotypes were more susceptible than those of the white to killing by either intact neutrophils or cell-free oxidants, including reagent hydrogen peroxide or the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl- system. Paralleling these findings, opaque blastoconidia were 2.8- to 3.6-fold more potent stimuli of neutrophil superoxide generation than were the white cells. In addition, both neutrophils and oxidants (reagent H2O2 or hypochlorous acid as well as the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl- system) induced unidirectional increases in spontaneous rates of switching from white to opaque phenotypes. Differences in expression of C. albicans phenotypes therefore may determine relative susceptibility to neutrophil fungicidal mechanisms, and neutrophils themselves appear to be capable of selectively augmenting the switching process.},

abstract = {Candida albicans is associated with humans as both a harmless commensal organism and a pathogen. Cph2 is a transcription factor whose DNA binding domain is similar to that of mammalian sterol response element binding proteins (SREBPs). SREBPs are master regulators of cellular cholesterol levels and are highly conserved from fungi to mammals. However, ergosterol biosynthesis is regulated by the zinc finger transcription factor Upc2 in C. albicans and several other yeasts. Cph2 is not necessary for ergosterol biosynthesis but is important for colonization in the murine gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Here we demonstrate that Cph2 is a membrane-associated transcription factor that is processed to release the N-terminal DNA binding domain like SREBPs, but its cleavage is not regulated by cellular levels of ergosterol or oxygen. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) shows that Cph2 binds to the promoters of HMS1 and other components of the regulatory circuit for GI tract colonization. In addition, 50{\%} of Cph2 targets are also bound by Hms1 and other factors of the regulatory circuit. Several common targets function at the head of the glycolysis pathway. Thus, Cph2 is an integral part of the regulatory circuit for GI colonization that regulates glycolytic flux. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) shows a significant overlap in genes differentially regulated by Cph2 and hypoxia, and Cph2 is important for optimal expression of some hypoxia-responsive genes in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. We suggest that Cph2 and Upc2 regulate hypoxia-responsive expression in different pathways, consistent with a synthetic lethal defect of the cph2 upc2 double mutant in hypoxia.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

The current release contains 6244 annotated entries corresponding to 130 tRNA genes and 5917 protein-coding genes. For these, it provides tentative functional assignments along with numerous pre-run analyses that can assist the researcher in the evaluation of gene function for the purpose of specific or large-scale analysis. CandidaDB is based on GenoList, a generic relational data schema and a World Wide Web interface that has been adapted to the handling of eukaryotic genomes. The interface allows users to browse easily through genome data and retrieve information. CandidaDB also provides more elaborate tools, such as pattern searching, that are tightly connected to the overall browsing system. As the C.albicans genome is diploid and still incompletely assembled, CandidaDB provides tools to browse the genome by individual supercontigs and to examine information about allelic sequences obtained from complementary contigs.

abstract = {Global repression of protein synthesis is a hallmark of the cellular stress response and has been attributed primarily to inhibition of translation initiation, although this mechanism may not always explain the full extent of repression. Here, using ribosome footprinting, we show that 2 hr of severe heat stress triggers global pausing of translation elongation at around codon 65 on most mRNAs in both mouse and human cells. The genome-wide nature of the phenomenon, its location, and features of protein N termini suggested the involvement of ribosome-associated chaperones. After severe heat shock, Hsp70's interactions with the translational machinery were markedly altered and its association with ribosomes was reduced. Pretreatment with mild heat stress or overexpression of Hsp70 protected cells from heat shock-induced elongation pausing, while inhibition of Hsp70 activity triggered elongation pausing without heat stress. Our findings suggest that regulation of translation elongation in general, and by chaperones in particular, represents a major component of cellular stress responses.},

abstract = {Fever is a universal response to infection, and opportunistic pathogens such as Candida albicans have evolved complex circuitry to sense and respond to heat. Here we harness RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to discover that the heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1, binds distinct motifs in nucleosome-depleted promoter regions to regulate heat shock genes and genes involved in virulence in C. albicans. Consequently, heat shock increases C. albicans host cell adhesion, damage and virulence. Hsf1 activation depends upon the molecular chaperone Hsp90 under basal and heat shock conditions, but the effects are opposite and in part controlled at the level of Hsf1 expression and DNA binding. Finally, we demonstrate that Hsp90 regulates global transcription programs by modulating nucleosome levels at promoters of stress-responsive genes. Thus, we describe a mechanism by which C. albicans responds to temperature via Hsf1 and Hsp90 to orchestrate gene expression and chromatin architecture, thereby enabling thermal adaptation and virulence.},

abstract = {Upon homozygosis from a/alpha to a/a or alpha/alpha, Candida albicans must still switch from the 'white' to 'opaque' phenotype to mate. It was, therefore, surprising to discover that pheromone selectively upregulated mating-associated genes in mating-incompetent white cells without causing G1 arrest or shmoo formation. White cells, like opaque cells, possess pheromone receptors, although their distribution and redistribution upon pheromone treatment differ between the two cell types. In speculating about the possible role of the white cell pheromone response, it is hypothesized that in overlapping white a/a and alpha/alpha populations in nature, rare opaque cells, through the release of pheromone, signal majority white cells of opposite mating type to form a biofilm that facilitates mating. In support of this hypothesis, it is demonstrated that pheromone induces cohesiveness between white cells, minority opaque cells increase two-fold the thickness of majority white cell biofilms, and majority white cell biofilms facilitate minority opaque cell chemotropism. These results reveal a novel form of communication between switch phenotypes, analogous to the inductive events during embryogenesis in higher eukaryotes.},

abstract = {Previous studies employing transmembrane assays suggested that Candida albicans and related species, as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, release chemoattractants for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Because transmembrane assays do not definitively distinguish between chemokinesis and chemotaxis, single-cell chemotaxis assays were used to confirm these findings and test whether mating-type or white-opaque switching affects the release of attractant. Our results demonstrate that C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata release bona fide chemoattractants for PMNs. S. cerevisiae, however, releases a chemokinetic factor but not a chemoattractant. Characterization of the C. albicans chemoattractant revealed that it is a peptide of approximately 1 kDa. Whereas the mating type of C. albicans did not affect the release of chemoattractant, switching did. White-phase cells released chemoattractant, but opaque-phase cells did not. Since the opaque phase of C. albicans represents the mating-competent phenotype, it may be that opaque-phase cells selectively suppress the release of chemoattractant to facilitate mating.},
